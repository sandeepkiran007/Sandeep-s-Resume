    is a great Habit a man can form in his lifetime, Its so crucial in this modern era whoever you are , a student, a teacher, a professor, a business man, an enterpreneur,
  a businessman, a leader, etc. If you want to improve yourself from where you are now you need to read books. There is books for everything you like to learn,
but there is also video tutorials for everything you can learn. but these video tutorials cannot replace reading and learning from a book because a book is crafted with intelligent
people with long great thinking and effort that they put into it to craft that book. So reading makes a full man, </p>
<p>So if you like to form a reading habit my advice to you is , Read what you love to read. If you want to form a habit on reading, don't read books which are toughest book on math . Read on subjects
  which are easy for you and after forming a habit read whatever you want.

    </b>Jogging with a friend is a great way to stay motivated and form a good workout habit. Exercising with someone around the same fitness level as you can spur each other on and make it more fun, increasing your chances of sticking to your exercise plan. It’s also a great way to meet new people

Writing down thoughts and ideas that you have throughout the day can improve your memory as your brain is more likely to retain that information
    </p>
